# Stock-Recommender
### A project for the Web Information Retrieval and Data Mining Course


The project includes a web-scraper that retrieves data from News API (real-time news) and AlphaVantage (stock information), to create a public sentiment recognition system, that recommends to buy or sell stocks. 
Three components are addded, and a weightage is assigned to the recommendations from all of them.
The first component is the Sentiment Analysis system.
The second is the time-series library Prophet (created by Facebook).
The third is a mixed neural-network architecture with RNN layers.

Theoretically, an ensemble system such as this should become better with more training data, so we train it upon data and information from previous years.
